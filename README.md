# HTTP-Server

## Project Requirements:

Given the npm modules, update the index.js file to:

* Require the dependency (the http module from Node)
* Create a server object and make sure it can: send header and send body response
* Use 3030, 3333, 8080, or 8000 as port numbers. When the server starts: log a message to the command line where the port is listening and the port number
* Server should GET requests with the text "Hello World" and should respond with a status code of 200
